# Comuna Finance

Comuna Finance is a decentralized finance protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain. It empowers communities to lend to each other, thereby fostering a cooperative, supportive, and financially inclusive ecosystem.

Through this protocol, communities can collectively pool funds, establish their lending parameters, and provide microloans to their members. The protocol's fundamental ethos is built around trust, cooperation, and financial empowerment of individual communities. 


## Key Features

- **Community-Driven Finance:** Comuna Finance allows communities to establish their microfinance banks, fostering a community-driven approach to lending and borrowing.
  
- **Peer-to-Peer Lending:** The protocol facilitates peer-to-peer lending, ensuring that funds are directly transferred from lenders to borrowers within the same community, without intermediaries.
  
- **Customizable Loan Parameters:** Each community can set its loan parameters, including interest rates, loan durations, and collateral requirements, ensuring the system works best for their specific needs.
